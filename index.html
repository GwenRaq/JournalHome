      <h3>Why I wanted to take this class?</h3> <!-- Why I took this class-->
      <!-- Im a child-->
      <p> I took this class because I want to be a Computer Engineer. I wanted to experience things that a computer can do like coding. I was also interested in coding when I heard about it from a field trip and when I heard it in the Library. <b></b></p>

  <h4>This week we learned how to make an html site</h4>
  <span><i>August 23,2016</i></span>
  <h5>Learning how to structure a web application</h5>
  <p>I learned how to make an html website. I made the website with Sublime Text and Git Shell. First, I learned the git commands which are git add, git commit -m, git status, and git push. Git add means your adding a specific file to sublime text. Git commit means you're initializing the project. Git status is for checking your projects status and git push means that you're uploading everything into your respository.
  </p>

  <p>Next, I learned some of the basics or components for putting a website together on sublime text. I leanrned how to make a paragraph element, a closing tag, a header, a block element, an inline element, how to add an image, and how to make a closing tag.
