      <h3>Why I wanted to take this class?</h3> <!-- Why I took this class-->
      <!-- Im a child-->
      <p> I took this class because I want to be a Computer Engineer. I wanted to experience things that a computer can do like coding. I was also interested in coding when I heard about it from a field trip and when I heard it in the Library. <b></b></p>

      <p> Something that I want to get out of this class is that I want to be able to know all the basics of coding. I also want to know how to use coding programs like Java.<span>code</span></p>
